# Q&A
* What is the difference between "preview" and "display" mode?

    Answer: When you are using the "preview" mode, the current settings won't be saved and you can exit preview mode by simply clicking on the window. In the "display" mode, all settings will be saved before entering the "display" mode.
* The program tells me to reinstall the program upon startup. What should I do?
    Answer: the "lang" folder may be in the wrong directory. Please make sure the folder is correctly placed in the same directory as the executable. If the problem continues to appear, try deleting the config.json file and try to run the program again. If the problem continous to occur, please consider reinstalling the program.
* The program doesn't show up when I try to run it. What should I do?
    Answer: First, please make sure your JVM satisfies the requirement. If you are sure it isn't your problem, please report the "log.txt" file to the developer via GitHub or send @ me at wbh3516@gmail.com.
